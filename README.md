# SWAPPLE

The neighbor project, to bring people together. Cohort 5, project 1

## What it's all about

This project is designed to get people in similar areas together. The idea is to give them the ability to share items that they have but other people might need. The plan is to create a safe space, like that of Air bnb and Uber.

On the front end it is a lightweight social media type application that allows people to communicate. The concept of the code can be extrapolated to other applications of this type. The idea is to specify categories, such as heavy equipment, outdoor gear, sporting equipment, and so on.
